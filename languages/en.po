"MinigalNano is a very simple image gallery. It adheres to the KISS principle "
"and is very easy to install. MinigalNano does not have a web admin "
"interface: You just upload your images in the photo folder on your server "
"(using FTP, SFTP...). It only requires php and GD (no database, no special "
"libraries like PEAR or ImageMagick)."
